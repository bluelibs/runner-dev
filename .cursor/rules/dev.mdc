## ðŸš¨ Tool Usage Priority

- This rule is included this means you have to help debug the current live server using the MCP.
- Prioritize to first run the graphql_schema_sdl and project_overview via MCP.
- You can do all sorts of things and you should prioritize working with the MCP graph before any other tools, even filesystem like readFile. You can get file contents through the MCP via GraphQL queries
- If you need to understand runner better, use the mcp with only tables and then you can search through the docs without full context dump.
